.SH DESCRIPTION
miniSphere is a general-purpose game engine which uses JavaScript for game coding, based on the Sphere engine developed by Chad Austin.
See
.BR minisphere (1)
for more information.

Typically, miniSphere is launched via the command
.BR minisphere (1).
When the engine is started that way, all debugging and logging features are disabled to maximize game performance.
.BR spherun (1)
is the preferred way to invoke the engine while developing a game.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB\-\-fullscreen
Start the engine in fullscreen mode. This option is ignored if
.B \-\-debug
is used (see below).
.IP \fB\-\-window
Start the engine in windowed mode. This is the default when the engine is started using the
.BR spherun (1)
command.
.TP
.BR \-d ", " \-\-debug
Instruct the engine to wait for the
.BR ssj (1)
debugger to attach before beginning game execution.
If no debugger attaches within 30 seconds, miniSphere will exit.
.TP
.BR \-v ", " \-\-verbose
Set the engine's diagnostic verbosity level.
This lets you to see under the hood at the engine's internal operation, which can often illuminate bugs in your game's logic.
If this option is not given, miniSphere will only print its version header and whatever output is generated by the game being executed.
.IP \fB\-\-no-sleep
Prevent the engine from going to sleep between frames.
miniSphere tries to minimize its CPU usage by sleeping between frames, which can sometimes trigger subtle game bugs.
Use this option to disable it temporarily as a debugging aid.
.IP \fB\-\-frameskip
Set the maximum number of consecutive frames to skip.
miniSphere skips rendering frames when it can't keep up with a game's requested framerate.
To ensure games remain playable, no more than 5 frames will be skipped by default.
Use this option to change the maximum; note that games can override the value you provide.
.IP \fB\-\-version
Show the version number of miniSphere along with the version numbers of any libraries it depends on.
