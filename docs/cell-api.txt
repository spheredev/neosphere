Cellscript API Documentation
============================

Cell is a scriptable build system and compiler for Sphere games. Like Sphere
itself, it uses JavaScript to control the build process.  This file documents
the public API used to write build scripts.

General
-------

install(asset, path);

    Installs one or more assets in 'path'.  The path is relative to the output
    directory.  'asset' can be either a single asset (see Assets below), or an
    array of them.


Assets
------

The basic build unit in Cell is an asset.  If you've ever used SCons, this is
similar in concept to a target.  Assets may either be installed directly or used
as input when building other assets, and Cell will automatically determine the
correct build order at runtime.

In this version of Cell, all assets are built independently.

files(pattern[, recursive]);

    Returns an array of assets for files matching the specified pattern.  File
    assets are unique: They have no build step associated with them and simply
    use the named file as-is.

    `pattern` is a wildcard (e.g. "*.png") combined with an optional path
    specifying the directory (relative to the input directory) to be searched.
    If 'recursive' is true, searches subdirectories as well.

sgm(manifest);

    Only one sgm() asset may be built in a single run.

    Builds a Sphere 1.x game manifest.  'manifest' is an object with metadata
    for the manifest being built.  The following properties must be present:

        name:       The title of the game, displayed in the engine's title bar.
        resolution: The game's default screen resolution.
        script:     The SphereFS path of the script containing the game()
                    function.

    The properties below are optional, but highly recommended:

        author:  The name of the author. If not provided, Cell will write
                 "Author Unknown".
        summary: A short, one-line summary of your game.  If not provided, Cell
                 will write "No description available." to the manifest.

    Any other properties will be ignored.  If you need additional metadata, you
    should use an s2gm() asset.

s2gm(manifest);

    Only one s2gm() asset may be built in a single run.

    Builds a Sphere 2.0 game manifest.  `manifest` will be converted to JSON and
    stored in the S2GM file as-is.  For required and recommended properties, see
    the documentation for the sgm() asset above.

    Note that if you need to maintain compatibility with Sphere 1.x, you can
    include an sgm() asset as well.
