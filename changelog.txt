minisphere Changelog
====================

v1.1.4 - May 26, 2015
---------------------

* Cleanup to Script Error screen: Subdirectory information is now shown for
  script filenames and the error location is displayed on a separate line from
  the error text.
* Evaluating non-UTF-8 scripts with extended characters no longer causes the
  engine to fail.
* Font:wordWrapString() now correctly handles newlines.

v1.1.3 - May 25, 2015
---------------------

* GetToggleState() is implemented--finally.
* Keys should no longer get "stuck" when using Alt+Tab to switch away from the
  engine during gameplay.
* Filename of map is now shown when an error occurs in an embedded script.

v1.1.2 - May 23, 2015
---------------------

* GLSL shader support! Shaders are loaded from <game_dir>/shaders by default.
  To use:
    var shader = new ShaderProgram({ vertex: 'vs.glsl', fragment: 'fs.glsl');
    var group = new Group(shapeList, shader);
    // work with Group object as before

v1.1.1 - May 20, 2015
---------------------

* Fixes an issue where windowstyles with component images smaller than 16x16
  weren't tiled properly, due to an Allegro limitation.
* Full MNG animation support.  No FLIC though.  That's an ancient format anyway
  though, not really worth supporting.
* Fixes GradientCircle (finally!) and adds missing circle methods to Surfaces.
* New RNG.name() API: Generates a random string of letters which you can use
  internally to differentiate objects.

v1.1 - May 17, 2015
-------------------

This is an absolutely MASSIVE release.  Note: minisphere is now BSD-licensed.
This basically gives you absolute freedom to do with the engine and associated
source code what you wish, so long as you don't misrepresent yourself as the
author.

* Fixes a ton of bugs discovered since the release of minisphere 1.0.10,
  including a SetPersonScript() crash when passing JS functions.
* Now using Allegro 5.1.10.
* Native 64-bit engine included (engine64.exe).
* New "Console" builds of minisphere (console.exe and console64.exe) for
  Windows. This version of the engine displays a console window like a debug
  build (enabling minisphere's Print() function to work), but is fully
  optimized.
* Constructors and properties for all core Sphere objects:
      var sound = new Sound("munch.wav");
      sound.volume = 128;
      sound.play(false);
* Massive performance improvements, both to rendering as well as resource
  loading. Most assets load lightning fast!
* Key mappings for GetPlayerKey() can now be set programmatically via the new
  SetPlayerKey() API; these changes will be saved per-game and loaded along with
  that game's game.sgm.
* Assert(), a useful debugging tool. Throws an error if the asserted condition
  fails, a no-op otherwise. In the Console build, also gives you the option to
  ignore the failed assert and continue.
* Async(), queues a script to run on the next FlipScreen(). Similar to what
  setTimeout() does in a browser and required for, e.g. compliance with the
  Promises/A+ spec.
* TurboSphere-inspired "Galileo" graphics API, which allows scenes to be
  composed ahead of time using Shape and Group objects.
* TurboSphere-inspired Sockets API, with separate ListeningSocket and
  IOSocket objects. Sphere 1.5 sockets are still supported.
* Built-in MT19937-based random number generator, including a method
  (`RNG.normal`) to generate normally-distributed random values.
* Includes miniRT, a unified set of system scripts including a cooperative
  threading engine, cutscene engine, the Link query library, and a full-featured
  console, among other goodies. Simply add this to the top of your main script:
      RequireSystemScript('mini/miniRT.js');
* The engine now searches <game_dir>/scripts/lib for system scripts before
  looking in the system directory.
* API documentation is included in the default distribution. It may be somewhat
  incomplete, however...
* Playback position in Sounds can be set with microsecond precision.
* Overhauled FollowPerson() algorithm: Followers move under their own
  power and are affected by obstructions, making the overall effect much
  more pleasing.
* New API functions to manage persons with followers:
      GetPersonLeader()
      GetPersonFollowers()
      GetPersonFollowDistance()
      SetPersonFollowDistance()
* New path escape: `#~/path/to/file` specifies a path which is relative to the
  engine's system directory.


v1.0.10 - April 16, 2015
------------------------

* Experimental 64-bit engine (needs testing).
* Fixes IsKeyPressed() not recognizing modifier keys on right side of
  keyboard (#20).
* Improves SetPersonFrame compatibility (out-of-range frame is now
  wrapped instead of throwing an error).
* Fixes SetPersonFrame not resetting frame delay timer.
* Fixes a joystick assert error when running minisphere in OS X. (#19)
* Fixes wrong direction being rendered for 4-direction person sprites
  moving diagonally.
* Fixes random deadlocks when playing sounds.
* Adds some API functions from Sphere 1.6+.
